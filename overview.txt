* DY(S): Dolev Yao clousers can be used to check if a message is deriable from adversary knowledge in Polynomial Time. 
* By DY(S) advarsary unable to knows the content of particular messages. That's why we need Indistinguisibility. 
* Parsing lemma used to proof RT theorem
* RT proof: used to show that a simple protocols can be analyzed in NP time. 
* Undecidability of Unbounded Insecure: Some problem's can not be decidable
* Undecidability problems can be solved by Incomplete Algorithms ( Horn Cluse, FO logic)
* Proverif works with Horn or FO logics under the hood.
