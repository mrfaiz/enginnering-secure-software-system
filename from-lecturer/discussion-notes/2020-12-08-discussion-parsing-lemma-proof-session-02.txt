ESSS December 8, 2020: Discussion Session Parsing Lemma Proof
-------------------------------------------------------------

Review Questions (about slides from video):
    
   - Proof of Parsing Lemma:
     - Why does it suffices to only prove derivability of the terms the adversary sends (i.e., why do we not need to discuss the FAIL constant)?
     
     moving from sigma to sigma' does not change the FAIL constant.
     
     - Why do we know that the last rule in the derivation of Ïƒ(x) can be assumed to be a compostion rule?
     - Why can we assume that the derivation of sigma(r_j) contains no step L_d(sigma(x))?
     
NP-c vs NP-hard:

Problem L_2 is 
 - "in NP":  L_2 is solvable in PTIME on nondeterministic TM
             (also: L_2 can be reduced to SAT)
             
 - NP-hard:  L_2 is "at least as difficult" as every problem L_1 in NP:
             every problem L_1 can be reduced to L_2:
             
             for all L_1 in NP: L_1 <=^p_m L_2:
             (L_1-questions can be translated into L_2 questions in PTIME)
             
 - NP-complete: L_2 is both 
             - in NP, and
             - NP-hard
