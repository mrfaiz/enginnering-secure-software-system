  - questions about last week (lecture 8)
       
     - three ways to specify crypto primitives: dy / stepwise derivations / equational theories.
       Advantages / disadvatnages of definitions?
       
       YES (4-5): eq theories are more natural 
       NO  (1-2): DY style modeling is more natural
       
     - notation in ProVerif: more operational, more natural. Why not used in theoretical model?
     
       saves time
     
     - Bob's process in Handshake protocol: point of last line?

       
t = dec(enc(N_A,k),k)

t --> N_A

t =_{E} N_A

equational theory:

x = x

t --> t

for equational theories that do not have a step t --> t ("simplification" that does not change anything), definition is equivalent to:

t in normal form if there is NO t' with t --> t'

takeaway: t in normal form if you cannot simplify t further,
                            <=> any "simplification step" to t' does not help you
                            <=> for any such step, t' is just t again (so no real simplification)
                            
A term t is NOT in normal form, if you can simplify it:
    <=> there is a step t ==> t' with t' "simpler" than t
    <=> (same for convergent subterm theories only) there is a step t ==> t' with t' different from t
