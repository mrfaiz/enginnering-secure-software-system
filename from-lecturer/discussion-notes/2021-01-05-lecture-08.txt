  - questions about last week (lecture 7)
  
     - PCP reduction (for undecidability): 
       - very similar to NP-hardness, can we also show undecidability of INSECURE with this?
       - (only for students with crypto background): which property of crypto schemes do we use here?
       
  equational theories:
  
  encA(k_B)(secret-message)
  
  decA(hat k_A)(encA(k_B)(secret-message)): no "simplification step" applicable (no equation applies)
  
  f(hash(x))
