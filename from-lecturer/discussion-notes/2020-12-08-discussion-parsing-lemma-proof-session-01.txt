ESSS December 8, 2020: Discussion Session Parsing Lemma Proof
-------------------------------------------------------------

Review Questions (about slides from video):
    
   - Proof of Parsing Lemma:
     - Why does it suffices to only prove derivability of the terms the adversary sends (i.e., why do we not need to discuss the FAIL constant)?
     - Why do we know that the last rule in the derivation of Ïƒ(x) can be assumed to be a compostion rule?
     - Why can we assume that the derivation of sigma(r_j) contains no step L_d(sigma(x))?
