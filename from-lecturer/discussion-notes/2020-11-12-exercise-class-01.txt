-------------------------------

3-message authentication protocol:

Alice:
  1. Send "A" to Bob
  2. Receive encrypted message (with k_A)
  3. decrypt, and encrypt & send for Bob (with k_B)
  
2-message authentication protocol:

banking protocol:

whatsapp authentication protocol:

WhatsApp authentication

mechanisms - crypto primitives:
  encryption?
  signatures?
  
First session with phone number: establish secret shared key k_{hs,WA}  
  
  
  
Website  -- QR Code --> Browser -- QR Code --> Phone App  

What if Charlie (ADV) gets the QR code? Browser gets access to Charlie's WA

My Phone App: Treat QR Code as N_{WA}^2
              Required: Coupling with ...
              
              After session establishment:
              
              Browser  <--> WA Website <--> Phone App
              
main assumptions:
  - trusted public key
  - "secure" phone network

usage:
  - key generated in first session used to authenticate later sessions
  
FIRST EXAMPLE PROTOCOL


SECOND EXAMPLE PROTOCOL

goal? use (N_A,N_B), or N_A, or N_B as symmetric key.
measures? encryption, challenge-response
issues? encryptions should bind nonces, names B 
        Bob decrypts everything "for alice"
